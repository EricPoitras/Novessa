They model the addition of unit fractions by folding papers and then drawing a model. For example, students solve 1/2 + 1/4. Then they add a unit fraction and non-unit fraction by drawing and writing models. Finally, students add two non-unit fractions.</p></span>

                <span id="id13" typeof="Reflecting"><p>Note:  This problem adds the complexity of finding the sum of two non-unit fractions, both with the numerator of 2.  Working with fractions with common numerators invites healthy reflection on the size of fifths as compared to thirds.  Students can reason that, while there are the same number of units (2), thirds are larger than fifths because the whole is broken into 3 parts instead of 5 parts.  Therefore, there are more in each part.  Additionally, it can be reasoned that 2 thirds is larger than 2 fifths because when fifteenths are used for both, the number of units in 2 thirds (10) is more than the number used in 2 fifths (6).</p>
                <img src="source/pic6lessong5sA1n1.PNG">
                <p>This problem also presents an opportunity to remind students about the importance of attending to precision (MP.6).  When comparing fractions, care is taken to talk about the same whole amount as demonstrated by the rectangle.  Such attention to precision also leads students to understand that 2 thirds of a cup is not larger than 2 fifths of a gallon.</p></span>

They should check work by comparing answers with a partner before going over answers as a class. Look for misconceptions or misunderstandings that can be addressed in the Debrief.  Guide students in a conversation to debrief the Problem Set and process the lesson.</p>
                <p id="id11" typeof="Presenting">T: For one minute, go over the answers to Problem 1 with your partner.  Don’t change your work.</p>

                <p><em>Continue with Problems 1(b–f).  Then, give students about 2 minutes to correct their errors.</em></p>

                <p>T: Steven noticed something about Problems 1 (a) and (b). Please share.</p>
                <p>S: The answer to (b) is smaller than (a) since you are adding only 1/5 to 1/2. Both answers are less than 1, but (a) is much closer to 1. Problem (b) is really close to 1/2 because 8/16 would be 1/2.</p>
                <p>T: Kara, can you share what you noticed about Problems 1(d) and (f)?</p>
                    <p>S: I noticed that both problems used thirds and sevenths.  But the numerators in (d) were 1, and the numerators in (f) were 2.  Since the numerators doubled, the answer doubled from 10 twenty-firsts to 20 twenty-firsts.</p></span>
